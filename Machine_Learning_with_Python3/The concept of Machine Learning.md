Machine Learning

Machine learning is to let the machine learn, to let the machine perform the task.
The earliest machine learning application was to identify junk mail in e-mail. The traditional method of using computers to solve problems is that users set different rules, define which emails are junk, and then let the computer execute the rules, but for many problems, it is difficult to define a rule, which is constantly changing.

Machine learning applications

Image Identification
Cat and dog recognition

How humans learn?
Sample materials---learn, summarize, organize---knowledge,experience---respond to similar tasks
How machine learn?
Input a lot of learning materials---machine learning algoritms---models---output results for the new input data

Examples of using machine learning in life:
    Determine if there is a risk in credit cards
    When using Google to research, based on some of the keywords the user enter, determine what the user want to search
    When browsing products, the ones user is most likely to buy.
    Language recognition
    Face recognition
    Financial forecasr
    Medical diagnosis
    Market analysis
Examples of using machine learning in the future:
    Autonomous cars
    Security field
