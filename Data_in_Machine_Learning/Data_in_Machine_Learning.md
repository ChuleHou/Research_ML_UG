Dataset:
a collection of related sets of information that is composed of separate elements but can be manipulated as a unit by a computer.
Sample Data:
Each line of data is called a sample
Feature:
Except for the last column, each list reaches a feature of the sample,the last column is called label

Features can be very abstract
In the Image, every pixel is a feature
For example, 28*28 images have 28*28=784 features
If it is a colorful image, it will has more features
